	0.21i - Add IRDA driver to support i models with a generic
	        USB-IRDA dongle using linux IRDA stack

27 Mar 2007	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.21 - minor bugfix

	* srd2hrm fix for non-S710 HRM models.

26 Feb 2007	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.20 - bugfix, significant enhancements

	* Matti Tahvonen provided a patch to handle files recorded with
	  interval mode on the S625X.  This patch has also been applied
	  to the S710/S720i code.  Matti also decoded a few more of the
	  bytes of the file header that we did not yet understand, 
	  including the byte that is set when interval mode is on.  The 
	  last 21 bytes of the S625X header remain to be decoded.

	* A bug that caused lap average speeds to be printed incorrectly
	  with srdhead/srdcat has been fixed.

	* A bug that wrote the "best lap split" data incorrectly in S610
	  .srd file output has been fixed.

	* The workout read/write/print code has been reorganized.  We
	  had accumulated a lot of duplicated code (~1200 lines) that 
	  has now been factored out.

	* A 'test' directory has been added to the tarball, containing
	  two files at present (one S625X and one S710).  I'd like to
	  collect files from other Polar models in this directory, so
	  we can have a way of ensuring that future changes don't break
	  existing code.

	0.19 - significant enhancement

	* Preliminary support for the S625X has been added.  The S625X
	  .srd file has a 130 byte header (compared with the 109 byte 
	  header of the S710/S720 and the 78 byte header of the S610).
	  I'm not sure what these extra bytes are for, so for the time
	  being, I'm simply ignoring them.  Lap and sample data appear
	  to be decoded correctly now.

23 Nov 2004	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.18 - significant enhancement

	* Added srdmerge, which permits users to merge .srd files and
	  thereby concatenate consecutively recorded workouts.
	
12 Nov 2004	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.17 - bugfix, significant enhancements

	* Fix compile on gcc 3.4.2.
	* Power data is correctly decoded now (thanks to Aldy Hernandez
	  for supplying sample files).
	* srdplot has been updated to generate graphs of power vs. time
	  and distance, as well as power histogram and zone graphs.
	* A new utility, srd2hrm, has been added.  This utility takes
	  one argument (the filename of a .srd file) and prints the file
	  to stdout in Polar's HRM format.
	
21 Sep 2004	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.16 - major enhancement

	* Support for S610, and automatic detection of HRM type 
	  (S610 or S710/S720i) has been contributed by Markus
	  Braun (see AUTHORS), based on Michael Karbach's (also
	  see AUTHORS) work decoding the S610 file format.

12 Aug 2004	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.15 - enhancements

	* incorporated another patch from Jani Averbach - computes
	  average speed of lap, adds to srdcat output.  Also added
	  a "VAM" column to output (average vertical velocity, in
	  either meters or feet per hour).  Useful for estimating
	  climbing speed (see www.53x12.com).
	* incorporated a set of patches from Frank Vercruesse
	  <frank at vercruesse dot de>:
	    - support for s710sh on Mac OS/X (see doc/README.osx)
	    - bugfix to s710sh
	    - additional configure option to enable alternate
	      serial inter-character timer mechanism for systems
	      that don't respect VTIME (see doc/README.osx)
	
28 May 2004	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.14 - quick fix

	* added configuration option to enable USB bulk reads instead
	  of interrupt reads (this should fix problems for people who
	  were trying to use 0.13 on 2.6 kernels).

19 May 2004	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.13 - Bugfixes, some more significant changes

	* libusb fix from Christian - use usb_interrupt_read instead of
	  usb_bulk_read - to work with 2.6.x kernels.
	* various patches from Jani Averbach: filenames saved in ISO
	  8601 time format <http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html>,
	  print lap distances and ascents as incremental values, not 
	  accumulated values, fix some compiler warnings on 64-bit
	  platforms.
	* patch from Berend Ozceri to enable AM/PM mode detection.
	* added doc/README.file_format-S610 from Michael Karbach.
	* added doc/README.610.file_format from Alex Dick.

27 Dec 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.12 - Bugfixes
	
		* s710sh should work better with serial dongle now.
		* Bug in detection of English/Metric units fixed (thanks to
		  Stefan Saring for pointing this out).
		* Cadence data should be decoded correctly now.
		* Avg, Min, Max temperature are not BCD in Metric units.

11 Oct 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.11 - Feature enhancements

		* Bidirectional USB communication works now (s710sh -d usb).
	
10 Oct 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.10 - Major feature enhancements, more file format info

		* From Max Matveev: bytes 3-9 of file format are the exercise
		  name if exercise number is 1-5 (i.e. not Basic Use).  Also,
		  user ID is BCD from 0 to 99 and is in byte 24 of the file.
		* s710sh now lets you change watch settings, synchronize the
		  watch to your computer's current time, and even reset the
		  watch to the factory defaults if you want to.  Functions to
		  do all of this have been made part of libs710.
		* S710_FILEDIR can now be set at configure time using the
		  --with-filedir configure option.
		* Some USB debug statements have been added.
	
07 Oct 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.09 - More file format elucidation, minor bugfixes

		* From Max Matveev: OwnCal quantities (energy, total energy);
		  corrections to cumulative counters (odometer, total ride 
		  time, total workout time); avg and max speed (finally!).
		* From Robert Estes - Lap speed, distance, ascent, temperature.
		* Plotting histograms works if HR data is all 0 now.
		* From Max Matveev: portability fixes for non-GNU compilers.
	
27 Sep 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.08 - Bugfix

		* workout.c was decoding Centigrade temperatures incorrectly.
		  Thanks to Max Matveev for this patch.
	
26 Sep 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.07 - Minor bugfix
		
		* Fixed a segfault in filter.c when no cadence data is 
		  present.

21 Sep 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.06 - More big developments.

		* The USB dongle is supported for s710d.  It does not yet
		  work for s710sh, because I don't yet know how to send 
		  packets over the USB interface.
		* Cadence data has been fixed by Stefan Kleditzsch
		* Filtering now filters invalid cadence data as well as
		  heart rate data.  Maximum valid values are set at 
		  configure time (./configure --help for more info).
		* Rewrote a bunch of code in comm.c to ease addition of
		  USB support.
		* Native IR support is no longer set at configure time,
	          it is always present.  Native IR is enabled via a 
		  command line option to s710d/s710sh now.

17 Sep 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>

	0.05 - Lots of changes.
	
		* Merged patches from Robert Estes regarding file format
		  decoding errors.
		* Moved filtering of HR data to a separate function so 
		  that read_workout()/extract_workout() don't necessarily
		  filter HR data (these functions now take a second argument
		  which is either S710_FILTER_OFF [the default] or 
		  S710_FILTER_ON).  Thanks to Robert Estes for suggesting
		  this.
		* Added explicit check for png library, as per suggestion
		  of Jan-Frode Myklebust.
		* Merged patches from Stefan Kleditzsch - CRC algorithm 
		  has been decoded!  Native IR is also supported now, for
		  computers which can do it.
		* Added configure option for native IR:  --enable-native-ir.
		* Added -f options to srdcat, srdhead, srdplot.  Using the
		  -f option causes data files to be filtered as they are
		  read.  The default is not to filter the data.
		* Added set_user function to test changing watch settings.

20 Aug 2002	Dave Bailey <dave at daveb dot net>
