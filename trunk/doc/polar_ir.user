# Sets up newly plugged in Polar USB interface so that just one certain user

USER=root

# can access it from user space. (Replace root by the user you want
# to have access to the device.)
#
# Note that for this script to work, you'll need all of the following:
# a) a line in the file /etc/hotplug/usermap that corresponds to the 
#    interface you are using (use the contents of polar_usb.usermap)
# b) run s710sh/s710d as the user given above
# c) a Linux kernel supporting hotplug and usbdevfs
# d) the hotplug package (http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/)
#
# In the usermap file, the first field "usb module" should be named 
# "polar_ir" like this script.
