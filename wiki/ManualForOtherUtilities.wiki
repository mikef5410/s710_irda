Manual for the SRD manipulations utilities

=srdcat=
==Purpose==
Print the srd file in human readable format to stdout. Includes the exercise summary, a summary of each lap and individual sample data.
==Usage==
{{{srdcat [-f] SRD_file}}} 

`-f` will turn on data filtering.
==Notes==

=srdhead=
==Purpose== 
Print the srd file in human readable format to stdout. Includes the exercise summary, a summary of each lap. Does not print individual sample data.
==Usage==
{{{srdhead [-f] SRD_file}}} 

`-f` will turn on data filtering.
==Notes==

=srdplot=
==Purpose== 
srdplot creates a bunch of PNG plots of the workout data contained in an srd file.
==Usage==
{{{srdplot [-f] SRD_file}}}

`-f` will turn on data filtering.
==Notes==

=srd2hrm=
==Purpose== 
srd2hrm converts srd format files to hrm (Polar) format
==Usage==
{{{srd2hrm [-f] SRD_file }}}

`-f` will turn on data filtering.
==Notes==
Data dumps to stdout. Use file redirection "srd2hrm SRD_file >myhrmfile.hrm"

=srdmerge=
==Purpose== 
srdmerge combines two srd files. It either does a "true" merge or a "concatenated" merge if the -c option is given.
==Usage==
{{{srdmerge [-c] [-f] <SRD file 1> <SRD file 2> <output SRD file name> }}}

`-c` does a concatenated merge instead of a true merge. -f will turn on data filtering.
==Notes==
A true merge fills the time between the end of the first exercise and the start of the second with zeros. A concatenated merge starts the second exercise immediately after the first. srdmerge will decide which exercise is first by looking at the start times in the srd files.
