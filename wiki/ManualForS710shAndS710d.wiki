#manual for s70sh and s710d

=s710d=
==Purpose== 
s710d is a daemon. It sits on the designated port and waits for the watch to begin a transfer.
s710d will stay alive until you kill it with -TERM or -INT. Dave made it this way so that you could just start it running and then forget about it.

==Usage== 
{{{>s710d [-d driver] [device file]}}}
 `driver` may be either `serial`, `ir`, or `usb`

 `device file` is required for serial and ir drivers.

Just start the connect function of your S710.
Push upper right button until "Connect" comes => press OK => Select "Select All" option => press OK
Now it should download the exercises ...

==Notes==
Output may be changed by the enviromental variable "S710_FILEDIR"
